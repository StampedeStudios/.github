## The Lore
The studio is born in the october 2020, composed by 4 starting members: Abramo, Gianfelice, Simone and Raffaele. Initially the team was composed by two developer, a 3D artist and a Game Designer. When the stuff to do increased exponentially, each of us covered a piece of game and level design and all decision about the design of the game was taken unanimously.

Today the team is composed by 4 people where only 2 are currently active. The team is focused in build mini-games using _Unity Engine_ and _Aseprite_ to improve internal know-how and skill-set.
