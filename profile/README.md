## The Lore
The studio is born in October 2020, composed of 4 starting members: Abramo, Gianfelice, Simone, and Raffaele. Initially, the team was composed of two developers, a 3D artist, and a Game Designer. When the stuff to do increased exponentially, each of us covered a piece of game and level design, and all decision about the design of the game was taken unanimously.

Today the team is composed of 4 people and only 2 are currently active. The team is focused in build mini-games using _Unity Engine_ and _Aseprite_ to improve internal know-how and skill set.
