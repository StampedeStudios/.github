## The Lore
The studio is born in October 2020, composed of 4 starting members: Abramo, Gianfelice, Simone, and Raffaele. Initially, the team was composed of two developers, a 3D artist, and a Game Designer. When the stuff to do increased exponentially, each of us covered a piece of game and level design, and all decision about the design of the game was taken unanimously.

Today the team is composed of 4 people but only 2 are currently active. The team is focused in build mini-games using _Unity Engine_ and _Aseprite_ to improve internal know-how and skill set.

## The Games
We worked on many projects but not as many have been deployed, the greater percentage of what we worked on was made to learn editors and try to gain the know-how to make games. Following, there is a short description for each deployed game.
